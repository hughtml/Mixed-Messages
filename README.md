#Mixed Messages

##General Info
This project was created as part of the Codecademy Full Stack Engineer Path.

The idea is that each time the user runs this program, a message will randomly generated and displayed. The topic of the program concerns songwriting prompts and the factors that build a song. The specification asks for 3 different pieces of data to randomise for each message, so the key/scale, time signature, and number of chords were selected.

The possibilites for each factor are stored in a dedicated array. A random number is generated 3 times, selecting the index from which the data will be drawn. Following this, a String holding the message is generated and displayed.
